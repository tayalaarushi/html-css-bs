There are two types of inline elements: replaced inline elements and non-replaced inline elements. In general, non-replaced elements are those whose content is contained in the document, whereas replaced-elements are those whose content is outside of the document. For example, in the code:

Visit the World Wide Web Consortium to learn about... the content of the a element is "World Wide Web Consortium". Replaced elements are those where the content comes from some external source, for example, an object or img element.

elements with display types inline-table and inline-block are considered replaced elements. Good examples of non-replaced inline elements are span, strong, i, b, em, etc.
